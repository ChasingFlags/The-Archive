### Veiled Dimensions
**Description:** Dive deep into the virtual realm and remember, duality hides the truth. Seek where they intertwine, and the solution will emerge.

#### Challenge Creation
I learnt about [VM-based obfuscation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKhX0Pk3a5A) while attempting to solve *Matryoshka*... so I created a simple one.

Thanks and :blue_heart: to @gynvael!

See the `challenge_files` folder for the original C file.

> **Compilation:**
>
> gcc -no-pie dimension.c -o dim
