## Overview
Welcome to The Archive, a curated repository of challenges created by the ChasingFlags. This archive not only preserves the challenges post-competition but also provides a rich resource for learning and practice.

### Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows: `CTF Name/Year`

Each CTF event is categorized by its name and the year it was held. For example, `CTFName/2021`.

Within each folder, you'll find the challenges associated with that particular event and year.

### Challenge Documentation
Each challenge is thoroughly documented with the following components:

**Local Setup Instructions**: Detailed steps to set up the challenge environment locally.

**Code and Comments**: For code-based challenges, the source code is provided along with explanatory comments for clarity.

**Links to Write-Ups**: Links to the official write-up for each challenge.

### Contribution Guidelines
Ensure that all challenges submitted have passed their competition expiration dates before uploading write-ups.

When adding a new challenge, create an appropriate folder structure (CTF name and year) if it doesn't already exist.

> This repository is dedicated to challenges that have expired from their respective CTF events.
> Each challenge in this archive is no longer active in its original competition format.
